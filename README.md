# execdb-drivers

*日本語版はこちら: [README_ja.md](README_ja.md)*

Cross-language driver test suite for [ExecDB](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb) —
verifies existing PostgreSQL client ecosystems connect with zero
ExecDB-specific setup.

ExecDB's own repository includes a Go/pgx-based protocol test
([`tests/pgclient`](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb/tree/main/tests/pgclient))
that already covers the wire protocol in depth — transaction isolation,
`25P02`, disconnect/`CancelRequest` cancellation. This repository exists
for a narrower, different purpose: proving that **other languages'
mainstream PostgreSQL drivers**, used with their own default settings
wherever possible, can connect to ExecDB and run basic
SELECT/DDL-rejection/transaction checks at all — the compatibility goal
described in
[ExecDB's spec §8](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb/blob/main/docs/spec/execdb_spec.md).

## Running the checks

Get an ExecDB binary (no need to clone the execdb repo — `go install`
fetches and builds it):

```sh
go install github.com/amisonnet8/execdb/cmd/execdb@latest
```

Then run whichever checks have their runtime installed:

```sh
./run-all.sh                      # uses "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/execdb", port 15538
./run-all.sh /path/to/execdb 15540  # or point at a specific binary/port
```

Each check connects, runs a small set of typed `SELECT`s, confirms DDL is
rejected with SQLSTATE `42501`, and does one INSERT+COMMIT+SELECT round
trip against a `t(a INTEGER)` table that `run-all.sh` seeds before
starting each check. A runtime that isn't installed is skipped (`skip -`),
not failed — see the table below for what each check needs.

| Directory | Driver | Runtime required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `python/` | psycopg2 (`python3-psycopg2`) | `python3` with `psycopg2` importable |
| `node/` | node-postgres (`pg`) | `node` + `npm` |
| `java/` | pgJDBC | `java` + `javac` (fetches the driver jar from Maven Central on first run) |
| `dotnet/` | Npgsql | `dotnet` SDK (restores the Npgsql NuGet package on first run) |
| `odbc/` | psqlODBC (via pyodbc) | `unixodbc` + `odbc-postgresql` (the driver itself) + `python3` with `pyodbc` importable |
| `php/` | PDO_PGSQL (via PDO) | `php` with the `pdo_pgsql` extension loaded |
| `ruby/` | `pg` gem | `ruby` with the `pg` gem installed (`gem install pg` / `gem install --user-install pg`) |
| `rust/` | `postgres`/`tokio-postgres` crate | `cargo` (fetches the crate from crates.io on first run) |

## What each check is actually proving

**Npgsql is the one exception to "default settings":** it needs
`Server Compatibility Mode=NoTypeLoading` in its connection string
(supplied by `run-all.sh`, not hardcoded in `dotnet/Program.cs`) to
connect to ExecDB at all. Without it, Npgsql's connection bootstrap sends
a batch of SELECTs against Postgres system catalogs (`pg_type`, `pg_enum`,
...) plus a bare `SELECT version()` to build its own type catalog --
SQLite has none of those, so the very first connection attempt fails
before any application query runs. This is a standard, Npgsql-native
option for connecting to a wire-compatible-but-not-genuine-Postgres
backend (the same one CockroachDB/Redshift-style databases document for
Npgsql users), not an ExecDB-specific patch, and none of the other
verified drivers need an equivalent client-side flag.

**psqlODBC needs no client-side flag, but only connects because of
server-side work on ExecDB's end.** Its own connection bootstrap queries
the real Postgres system catalog (`pg_type`, checking for large-object
support), and its `SQLTables`/`SQLColumns` calls (used by `odbc/check.py`,
and by real schema-browsing ODBC consumers like Excel/Power BI/Access)
query `pg_class`/`pg_namespace`/`pg_attribute`/`pg_attrdef` plus the
`pg_get_expr()`/`current_schema()` built-in functions. ExecDB answers all
of these with a small pg_catalog-compatible set of temp views/functions,
set up once per pgwire connection -- see
[`cmd/execdb/pgcatalog.go`](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb/blob/main/cmd/execdb/pgcatalog.go)'s
doc comments for exactly what is (and is not) emulated, and
[execdb's `.claude/rules/pgwire.md`](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb/blob/main/.claude/rules/pgwire.md)
for how this was discovered and why views couldn't just live in a real
attached `pg_catalog` database.

**PHP (PDO_PGSQL) and Ruby (`pg` gem) are, like psycopg2, thin wrappers
around libpq** -- the actual wire-protocol work all three do is identical
C code, so neither adds new protocol coverage on that front. They still
earn their own checks because of what sits *above* libpq: PDO_PGSQL
defaults to "emulated prepares" (`PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES` true by
default for this driver), substituting parameter values into the SQL text
client-side and sending the result as plain Simple Query text -- a
materially different code path from every other verified driver (all of
which use real Extended Query parameter binding by default). Ruby's `pg`
gem, via `exec_params`, does use real Extended Query binding, exercising
that path independently of psycopg2's own specific usage pattern.

**Rust's `postgres`/`tokio-postgres` crate is a genuine, independent
reimplementation of the wire protocol** (no libpq involved), and its
stricter, statically-typed API surfaced two real ExecDB bugs beyond
anything the other 7 drivers found:

1. Its default (type-unaware) `query`/`execute` methods leave a
   parameter's OID unspecified and rely on the server's
   `ParameterDescription` to resolve it. Told 0 (ExecDB's "unspecified"
   answer, tolerated by every other driver), it queries
   `pg_catalog.pg_type`/`pg_range`/`pg_namespace` to look up what type 0
   supposedly is -- which doesn't exist, so it asks again, forever, until
   its stack overflows. `rust/src/main.rs` avoids this by using
   `prepare_typed` to self-declare each parameter's type up front (the
   same thing pgJDBC/Npgsql already do implicitly), the same fix a real
   Rust application would need.
2. A client that only ever Describes a *statement* (never a *portal*) --
   a valid, allowed message sequence tokio-postgres happens to use by
   default -- exposed a real inconsistency: `Execute` was recomputing the
   result column's type from the live query result instead of reusing
   whatever type the earlier `Describe` had already promised via
   `RowDescription`, and those two could legitimately disagree (a NULL
   trial-run's inferred type vs. a real bound value's). ExecDB now caches
   and reuses the Describe-time OID
   (`preparedStatement`/`portal`'s `resultOIDs`,
   [`cmd/execdb/pgextended.go`](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb/blob/main/cmd/execdb/pgextended.go))
   -- a fix that benefits every driver, not just this one.

Both are written up in full in
[execdb's `.claude/rules/pgwire.md`](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb/blob/main/.claude/rules/pgwire.md).

## Why these aren't wired into a Go test suite

None of these runtimes are part of ExecDB's own build or a required
developer tool for the main repository; they're installed on demand.
`run-all.sh` runs each check only if its runtime is present on `PATH`,
and prints a `skip -` line otherwise. This is also why the Node dependency
(`pg`) and the Java driver jar are fetched into gitignored locations
(`node/node_modules/`, `java/lib/`) instead of being committed. The .NET
package (Npgsql) is restored by `dotnet` into its own NuGet cache
(`~/.nuget/packages`, outside this repo entirely); only the per-project
`dotnet/bin/`/`dotnet/obj/` build output directories need gitignoring.
Rust's crate (`postgres`) is similarly cached under `~/.cargo/registry`;
only `rust/target/` (the build output) is gitignored -- `rust/Cargo.lock`
itself is committed for a reproducible dependency graph. PHP's
`pdo_pgsql` extension and Ruby's `pg` gem have no local build output at
all to gitignore (a system package and a user-installed gem,
respectively).

## History

This repository was split out of
[amisonnet8/execdb](https://github.com/amisonnet8/execdb)'s
`tests/drivers/` directory, where it was developed alongside ExecDB's
PostgreSQL wire-protocol implementation. execdb itself now keeps only its
Go/pgx-based protocol test (`tests/pgclient`).
